abstract = {Wound surface area changes over multiple weeks are highly predictive of the wound healing process. Furthermore, the quality and quantity of the tissue in the wound bed also offer important prognostic information. Unfortunately, accurate measurements of wound surface area changes are out of reach in the busy wound practice setting. Currently, clinicians estimate wound size by estimating wound width and length using a scalpel after wound treatment, which is highly inaccurate. To address this problem, we propose an integrated system to automatically segment wound regions and analyze wound conditions in wound images. Different from previous segmentation techniques which rely on handcrafted features or unsupervised approaches, our proposed deep learning method jointly learns task-relevant visual features and performs wound segmentation. Moreover, learned features are applied to further analysis of wounds in two ways: infection detection and healing progress prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to automate long-term predictions of general wound healing progress. Our method is computationally efficient and takes less than 5 seconds per wound image (320 by 640 pixels) on a typical laptop computer. Our evaluations on a large-scale wound database demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Wound healing remains a challenging clinical problem and correct, efficient wound management is essential. Much effort has been focused on wound care with an emphasis on new therapeutic approaches and the development of technologies for acute and chronic wound management. Wound healing involves multiple cell populations, the extracellular matrix and the action of soluble mediators such as growth factors and cytokines. Although the process of healing is continuous, it may be arbitrarily divided into four phases: (i) coagulation and haemostasis; (ii) inflammation; (iii) proliferation; and (iv) wound remodelling with scar tissue formation. The correct approach to wound management may effectively influence the clinical outcome. This review discusses wound classification, the physiology of the wound healing process and the methods used in wound management. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 Field House Publishing LLP.},

abstract = {Ulcer tissue segmentation is of immense importance in helping medical personnel to assess wounds. This paper introduces a new computational framework employing state-of-the-art image processing techniques to segment pressure ulcer tissue structures from color images. The framework integrates a visual appearance model of an observed input image with prior color information from an available database of previously stored color RGB images. The following four processing steps are performed. First, to minimize the execution time and enhance the segmentation accuracy, a region-of-interest (ROI) of the whole ulcer area is automatically identified based on contrast changes. This step exploits synthetic frequencies of pixelwise intensities, which are calculated by using an electric field energy model to describe relations between the pixelwise intensities. Secondly, visual appearance of the observed image is modeled by a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG) model in order to estimate marginal probability distributions of three main tissue classes for the grayscale ROI image. Next, the pixel-wise probabilities of these classes for the color ROI image are calculated using the available prior information about the RGB colors on manually segmented database images. Initial labeling is obtained based on both the observed and prior probabilities of pixelwise colors. Finally, to preserve continuity, the labels are refined and normalized using the generalized Gauss-Markov random field (GGMRF) model. Experimental validation on 24 clinical images of pressure ulcers, provided by the Centre IGURCO, showed the high segmentation accuracy of 90.4\%.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Pressure ulcers are regions of trauma caused by a continuous pressure applied to soft tissues between a bony prominence and a hard surface. The manual monitoring of their healing evolution can be achieved by area assessment techniques that include the use of rulers and adhesive labels in direct contact with the injury, being highly inaccurate and subjective. In this paper we present a Support Vector Machine classifier in combination with a modified version of the GrabCut method for the automatic measurement of the area affected by pressure ulcers in digital images. Methods: Three methods of region segmentation using the superpixel strategy were evaluated from which color and texture descriptors were extracted. After the superpixel classification, the GrabCut segmentation method was applied in order to delineate the region affected by the ulcer from the rest of the image. Results: Experiments on a set of 105 pressure ulcer images from a public data set resulted in an average accuracy of 96\%, sensitivity of 94\%, specificity of 97\% and precision of 94\%. Conclusions: The association of support vector machines with superpixel segmentation outperformed current methods based on deep learning and may be extended to tissue classification.},

abstract = {Chronic wound is an abnormal disease condition of localized injury to the skin and its underlying tissues having physiological impaired healing response. Assessment and management of such wound is a significant burden on the healthcare system. Currently, precise wound bed estimation depends on the clinical judgment and remains a difficult task. The paper introduces a novel method for ulcer boundary demarcation and estimation, using optical images captured by a hand-held digital camera. The proposed approach involves gray based fuzzy similarity measure using spatial knowledge of an image. The fuzzy measure is used to construct similarity matrix. The best color channel was chosen by calculating the mean contrast for 26 different color channels of 14 color spaces. It was found that Db color channel has highest mean contrast which provide best segmentation result in comparison with other color channels. The fuzzy spectral clustering (FSC) method was applied on Db color channel for effective delineation of wound region. The segmented wound regions were effectively post-processed using various morphological operations. The performance of proposed segmentation technique was validated by ground-truth images labeled by two experienced dermatologists and a surgeon. The FSC approach was tested on 70 images. FSC effectively segmented targeted ulcer boundary yielding 91.5\% segmentation accuracy, 86.7\%, Dice index and 79.0\%. Jaccard score. The sensitivity and specificity was found to be 87.3\% and 95.7\% respectively. The performance evaluation shows the robustness of the proposed method of wound area segmentation and its potential to be used for designing patient comfort centric wound care system.},

abstract = {Minimum cut/maximum flow algorithms on graphs have emerged as an increasingly useful tool for exactor approximate energy minimization in low-level vision. The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style "push -relabel" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style "augmenting paths." We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes.},

abstract = {The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background segmentation in still images is of great practical importance in image editing. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 ACM.},
